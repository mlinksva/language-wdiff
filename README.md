# language-wdiff package for Atom

In the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) highlights added and removed text as described by the output of the [`wdiff`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/) command saved in a file with a `.wdiff` extension.

If you want to see more common line diffs highlighted in files with a `.diff` extension, you need the [language-diff](https://atom.io/packages/language-diff) Atom package.
